# MMORPG Centralized API and Game Servers
=============================================================================

This project is an open-source MMORPG server and client system, designed for both commercial use and learning purposes. It provides a centralized API Server and various game servers (Chat, Login, World, Channel) for managing multiplayer functionality in a massive online game, along with a game client.

Our goal is to provide a foundation for developers to create their own MMORPGs, offering a flexible, scalable server system that can be customized to suit the needs of various projects. Whether youâ€™re building a game for commercial release or using it as a learning tool to understand how MMORPGs work, this project aims to support your efforts.

# Client
The project includes a game client that is currently under development. The client is being designed to work seamlessly with the MMORPG server infrastructure, and will include features such as character creation, in-game navigation, interaction with NPCs, and more.

# State of Development
The project is in active development and is progressing towards a fully functioning MMORPG server system with an integrated client. Many features of typical online role-playing games have been implemented, but it remains a work in progress with more features to be added.

Features currently being implemented:
API Server:
Acts as a command relay between the game servers (Chat, Login, World, Channel).
Receives admin commands and forwards them to appropriate servers for execution.
Game Servers:
Chat Server: Handles chat features like global announcements, player messaging, and guild chats.
Login Server: Manages player logins, authentication, and session management.
World Server: Oversees world events, NPC interactions, and player interactions.
Channel Server: Handles game instances, player actions, and balancing between different channels.
Features in progress:
Client Development

Basic in-game character creation and movement.
NPC interaction and quest systems.
Combat and Skills System

Player vs. Environment (PvE) combat.
Basic skill systems and leveling.
Player Guilds

Implementation of player guilds, including chat, events, and coordination.
Quests and NPC Dialogues

Requirements
The MMORPG server system is developed using Java 17 and Netty for networking, and it requires MySQL for persistent storage. To run the system, the following tools are needed:

# Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+
Netty (for non-blocking I/O and networking)
MySQL or compatible database server (e.g., MariaDB)

# Needed Collaborators
We are actively looking for collaborators with expertise in the following areas:

UI/UX Design: Help design a user-friendly interface for the game client.

Sound Design: Create immersive sound effects and background music.

2D Artists/Animators: Design character models, animations, and environmental assets.

Game Designers: Help develop in-game mechanics, quests, and world-building.

Backend Engineers: Assist with scaling the server infrastructure and improving performance.

If you are interested in contributing to any of these areas, please reach out! We welcome both experienced professionals and those looking to grow their skills through collaboration.
